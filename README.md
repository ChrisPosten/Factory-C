# Factory-C
Object-Oriented Programming in C (OOP in C or OOC) (Factory C)

Factory/OOC/Readme.txt for the actual readme.

        This Project is for a more strategic definition of OOP. Instead of a single virtual table like in C++
    there is a twin virtual table configuration and a factory table of classes thats used to store each 
    classes interface heap. The interface heap for a class may contain the class extended interface and
    also contains "registration" interfaces that, each one only would have one or two methods by default
    and one of those methods may be a factory method for a class information table or sub heap of the 
    class interface heap. The factory method pattern is used for the virtual table object factory, a 
    factory table class with a "class(FactoryTable)". This pattern differs in Factory C a little, if 
    you can tell, one being used for an interface heap is the class factory method or a map. There is an
    adapter table for storing the self pointer for an object adapter, observer, decorator. There is a 
    non-dyanmic and dynamic class, with polymorphism betweenthe two. Learn to use the factory table 
    multimap and Factory C will be in your pocket. Everything from OOC/Object/... ecspecially Object.h 
    and structclass.h have the datatypes defined to use with the multimap. There also is the most super 
    cool thing in the world in Factory C and Its called the "ControlFactory" it is a series of functions
    being returned from one another as factory functions that encapsulate a factory function called 
    strategically from an array. The control factory does a for loop in the form of a statement, saving
    the returns like the condition evaluations on a stack, using its template method it can be used for
    anything, Workspace.h has examples of its use, including its cout example. There is infile documentation.
